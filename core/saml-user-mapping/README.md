# About `saml-user-mapping`

SAML authorizations contain a number of Attributes that can be mapped for a particular user account.  Based on the OpenSAML parsing of the response, this mapper will translate those values to a Nuxeo Principal account.  This example can be used to map the first & last names as well as email.  The native SAML identifier is used for the system username.
