# About **alert-count-widget**

Assume you have a folder called Alerts that contains Alerts. This widget displays the count of alerts as a link to that folder.
But the real point is that it's an example of using [OperationActionBean](http://explorer.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/distribution/cap-8.3/viewSeamComponent/seam:operationActionBean) to display the result of Automation in JSF.

## Installation

Install `alert-count-widget.xhtml` in the `Resources` section of the Nuxeo Studio project as a `Widget` template.

## Support

**These features are not part of the Nuxeo Production platform.**

These solutions are provided for inspiration and we encourage customers to use them as code samples and learning resources.

This is a moving project (no API maintenance, no deprecation process, etc.) If any of these solutions are found to be useful for the Nuxeo Platform in general, they will be integrated directly into platform, not maintained here.
