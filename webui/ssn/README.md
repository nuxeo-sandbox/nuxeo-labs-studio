# About

Simple element that displays the value of a field holding a social security number:

* By default, the value is obfuscated (********* instead of the clear value)
* A button allows for toggling the display (display the value or the "*")
  * Once displayed, it automatically hides the value after 8 seconds
* `administrators` and users members of `allowedGroups` can see the widget. Others see nothing (not even ******)


# Installation

* Install the content in the `ui` folder as Resources in Designer
* Import it in the custom bundle generated by Designer (`nuxeo-{YOUR_PROJECT_ID}-custom-bundle.html`). For example, if you dropped the `ssn` folder in `ui`, add the following line to the bundle:

```
<link rel="import" href="ssn/nuxeo-se-ssn-read.html">
```

# Usage
Just use the element and its required attributes: `document` and `ssnField`. To allow non admin users to see the value, also use `allowedGroups`. The later must be passed as JSON, which means double quotes inside, single quote outside:

```
<nuxeo-se-ssn-read document="[[document]]"
                   ssn-field="person:ssn"
                   allowed-groups='["grp1","grp2","grp3"]'></nuxeo-se-ssn-read>
```
